Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png" alt="config.yml">
  </div>
</div>

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
